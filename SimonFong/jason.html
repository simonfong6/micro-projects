	<h2>Biography</h2>
	<p>
	I like babies very much. Especially their crying screams when they are slightly uncomfortable and
	 disturb people working in a silent building or flying tube. Just to be clear to whom it may concern,
	 I DO NOT LIKE babies in any weird way. For example, babies do not activate the happy center of my
	 brain that is the source of pedophilia, I just like them in all the normal ways that people like
	 babies. They are just so darn cute. I mean with all their little, puggy fingers and toes, and their
	 little iddy bitty heads with such great big eyes like dinner plates. I wear glasses, I am Korean, I
	 eat Korean food, Chipotle, and Starbucks, and screw you everyone, I do indeed have eyes.

	<p>Babies are not the only things that bring joy to my life, skating tends to brighten my day when
	 I am having a down day. Devin, Michael, and Spencer can all suck dicks. They are giant buttholes, like
	 humungous buttholes. Fuck you all. I have skated with all of them and they all suck dicks. While
	 they are good at skating and possibly even better than me, unbelievable right?, better than me?!,
	 shocking!, they are the definition of each curse word in the English dictionary. Asses, bitches, douches
	 and even *****. Anyways skating is passion, my dream. It is exhilarating to feel the cold wind on my face
	 and feeling every little rock the wheels come in contact with.

	<h2>Biography</h2>
	<p>
	My skin is brown, but not too brown. The browness comes my lineage originating in the Philipines,
	 which is a country located near the equator. Due to this, there are more hours of daylight per day
	 in the Philipines than in more northern countries. Its location on the Earth also makes the Sun's rays
	 stronger. With all these factors involved, the people in the Filipines have become darker. The shade
	 of people's skin is caused by how much melanin is produced and more is produced with more sun
	 exposure to protect skin cells.

	Some of my favorite ways to spend time are to solve puzzle cubes, play basketball, suck dick, and
	 play video games. With practice, the time it takes me to solve a mixed up cube has dropped below
	 thirty seconds. A more active passtime of mine is basketball. I enjoy touching the big orange
	 ball with my hands and putting pressure on it to distance it into the air. From the air, it enters
	 the horizontal circle with the white strings underneath. Another one of passions is penis. Penis is
	 just... just... just the best thing in the world and even better when it is in my mouth. My favorite
	 video game is <u>Attack on Titan</u>, which is based on the popular anime of the same name. Although
	 that show is somewhat interesting, the most interesting show, in my opinion, is "La Catrina". It
	 combines some of my favorite aspects of TV shows, an interesting plot, a character you care deeply for,
	 and special effects that will awe you.

	I do not share this with everyone, but I secretly want to be a girl. A girl that wears frilly things like
	 nice pretty bows and dresses.
